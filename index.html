          <h2>Edward Young Chapin IV, 64, known by many as Chape, left this earth on August 6<sup>th</sup>, 2011.</h2>
          <p>
            He enjoyed a career that reflected his many interests. He was the owner/operator of
            radio station WLOM-FM that he later sold to Ted Turner. He was a long-time President
            of Rock City Gardens during which time he was involved in the Young President's
            Organization and served as president of the Southern Highlands Attractions Association,
            Georgia Hospitality and Travel Association, Chattanooga Convention and Visitors Bureau
            and Georgia Chamber of Commerce. He founded Chattanooga Computer Center and was the
            region's first Apple computer dealer back when personal computing was a new concept.
            He continued to work with and consult on technology and information systems throughout
            his career. He received a number of awards and commendations for his professional work
            including being twice recognized by Forbes Magazine with their Business in the Arts
            Award and being recognized as one of Tennessee's Outstanding Young Men.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was a man of immense intellect with an unquenchable passion for learning. His
            children quickly learned when they were young that if you asked him a seemingly
            simple question, he would literally tell you how something worked, how it was made
            or its historical evolution. He was also the rare soul to receive a perfect score
            of 800 on both the math and English sections of the SAT. He was an ardent alum of
            Princeton University where he earned a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and was a member
            of the Key and Seal club. He earned an MBA from Emory University in Atlanta.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was a renaissance man with diverse interests and talents. He was a Master Gardener
            with an uncanny memory of plant names and varieties and a love of exotic hostas. He
            was a skilled woodworker and woodturner who not only enabled beautiful things to emerge
            from a raw piece of wood but also actively participated in the Tennessee and American
            Woodworking Associations to promote the art and was engaged in teaching others as a
            volunteer. He was an avid sailor and served as Commodore of Privateer Yacht Club. He
            had a love for astronomy and spent many hours navigating the stars and planets with his
            children and grandchildren. He was a private pilot. He was a lover of music from classical
            to the Canadian Brass. In recent years, he and his wonderful friends pressed and bottled
            many vats of grapes into wine. 
          </p>
          <p>
            He was an active community member and volunteer. 
          </p>
          <p>
            He was a member of the Downtown Chattanooga Rotary Club for 39 years, and he was a fixture
            at a front row table every Thursday. He was an active member and Past President of the
            Chattanooga Engineer's Club and a member of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers.
          </p>
          <p>
            He devoted countless hours to coaching local elementary and high school children to victory
            in FIRST Lego League educational robotics competitions that promote the benefits of STEM
            (Science-Technology-Engineers-Math). His teams consistently winning top honors thrilled his
            heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            He helped his brother architect Garnet Chapin design and manufacture the original brass
            plaques and all the historical signage on the Walnut Street Bridge and the Tennessee
            Riverwalk below the bridge and has been involved in the current plaque replacement for
            the bridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was one of five men who led the effort to establish the 9-1-1 system and Emergency
            Medical Technician programs in Northwest Georgia and in Hamilton County, TN. He served as
            Regional VP of the Tennessee Association of Rescue Squads, Deputy Chief of the
            Chattanooga-Hamilton County Rescue Service and Deputy Chief of the Lookout Mountain,
            Georgia, Fire Department. He also served as a volunteer medical first responder for many
            years... an avocation that had him rappelling down cliffs to save climbers or hikers or
            dashing to the homes of others in the community when tragedy struck in the middle of the night.
          </p>
          <p>
            He quietly funded many of the programs he supported. His many efforts are too numerous to list. 
          </p>
          <p>
            He was a husband, father and grandfather with unbounded love for his family. He was a
            man of quiet strength, incredible patience and constant support. He was always the one
            to call when something was broken or when answers were needed fast. His generosity of
            spirit also manifested itself in not only the "big things" but also the "little things"
            like leaving a gallon of milk in your fridge because he noticed you needed one. His
            grandchildren would also say he played a good game of Go Fish.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was predeceased by his beloved mother, Mildred Toner (Toni) Chapin.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was predeceased by his wife, Linda Standefer Chapin, on September 10, 2009. He first met
            her at a graduation party where he said she was not only the most beautiful girl in the room
            but also likely the only girl who would be impressed that he was a state math award winner
            rather than a football player. They were devoted to each other for more than forty five years
            despite them both leaving this earth too soon. His children know that as his hand slipped from
            theirs, he must have been reaching for hers.
          </p>
          <p>
            He leaves behind three children: Betsy (Brent) Taylor of Chattanooga, Ted Chapin of Nashville
            and John Chapin of Nashville. He also leaves two grandchildren: Elise Taylor and Grace
            Taylor-who believed the world did indeed circle around their Papa. He is survived by
            brother-in-law Buz (Barbie) Standefer, sister-in-law Karen (Steve) Nicely and brother-in-law
            Jim (Carolyn) Schreeder. He is survived by his father E.Y. (Hilda) Chapin III, brother Garnet
            (Nina) Chapin, brother Jim (Erin) Chapin and sister Mary (Ken) Young. He also has many nieces
            and nephews.
          </p>
          <p>
            The family asks that in lieu of flowers memorial contributions be made to the Linda Standefer
            Chapin Governance Award at Girls Preparatory School.

            Our father pursued greater knowledge all of his life. He believed education to be of benefit not only to
            individuals, but to their community as well. Our family and our father's friends seek to continue his work
            by supporting causes to which he devoted his life. Join us in helping others finding fulfillment in their
            life's journey through education.
